                    <h1>Background of this Study:</h1>
                    <p>This study was conducted by group 8 of 9-Lithium. Our group conducted research on the trade of pharmaceutical products of 5 different continents, Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America, from 2018 - 2020. We chose 5 countries per continent to sample and from those 5 countries, we picked 2 data points for each country for import and export. This process was 3 times for each of the years from 2018 - 2020. From this, we gathered a total of 150 different data points, with 5 variables. Those variables can be divided into 2 categories, the qualitative and quantitave variables. For our qualitative variables, we had 3, which were continent, country, and flow. For our quantitative variables, we had 2, these were trade (in USD) and weight (in kg). This study was done to determine which continent contributed most to global trade and if the weight had anything to do with the economic value of the pharmaceutical products.</p>
                    <p><span>The reason why this was our topic chosen was because one factor that drives the world into its continuous growth and development is its economu. And the way our economy continues to grow is through trade, most specifically national trade. Trade allows opportunities for numerous countries across different continents to grow and develop, and share these advancements with one another, be it through materials, goods, or other means of trading. An example of those goods would be pharmaceutical products which are highly important in todays society as the continuous need for medical supplies grows, the trading of these products are highly valuable.</span></p>
